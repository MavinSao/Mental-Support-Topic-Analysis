# Mental Health Support Topic Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes mental health support discussions using advanced natural language processing techniques. The analysis focuses on Reddit's submission from mental health-related support subreddits to identify key topics and patterns in support-seeking and support-providing behaviors.

## Components

### Dataset
- Source: Reddit mental health support subreddits
- Data includes: title, selfttext, timestamps, subreddit, link_flair_text
- Time period: 2015-2025
- Data preprocessing includes content filtering and anonymization

### Analysis Methods

#### BERTopic Analysis
- Implementation of BERTopic for topic clustering
- Identification of main discussion themes
- Hierarchical topic modeling
- Temporal topic analysis

#### LLaMA 2 Topic Representation
- Natural language description of identified topics
- Contextual understanding of discussion patterns
- Topic coherence evaluation

## Key Features
- Topic modeling with BERTopic
- Topic evolution tracking over time
- Integration of transformer-based language models
- Privacy-preserving data handling

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- BERTopic library
- LLaMA 2 model dependencies
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

## Usage
1. Data preprocessing scripts
2. Topic modeling pipeline
3. LLaMA 2 analysis interface
4. Visualization tools

## Ethical Considerations
- Strict adherence to privacy guidelines
- Responsible handling of sensitive information
- Ethical use of mental health data

## Results
- Topic distribution analysis
- Temporal pattern identification
- Support dynamics insights
- Community interaction patterns
